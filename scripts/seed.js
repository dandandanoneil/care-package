For the entirety of my time in Philly I've been working freelance and paid estimated taxes to the feds. Given this, I felt that if I only filed my tax return for New York State along with my federal return, that would suffice.\nNow, I'm second-guessing myself, and probably for good reason.Do freelancers have to pay state taxes? And how would I file taxes for two states, for free I mean?",
